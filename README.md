# Time Series Regression using .R

Used tslm function to fit a multiple regression model with time series data while checking residuals for auto-correlation, trend and seasonality

R libraries: fpp3, 
using regression as a modeling technique

* scatter plot
* The tslm function fits a regression model with time series data
* several relationships in the data
* can use tslm to fit a multiple regression model 
* With time series regression it is always good to check the fit as a time series plot
* actual by predicted plot
* Check the residuals for auto-correlation
* trend and seasonality
* In tslm, trend and seasona are keywords that can be used to create a regression model
* When you have a good model, the "forecast" function can be applied to the fitted model
* Sometimes non-linear models will be more useful
